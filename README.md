# Eco-Explore-1-POAP
To create this work, I decided to use the colors of the brand logo - four primary colors. I used colors to highlight the "one" word. In the background, you can see the image of money (dollar sign) in pretentious glasses, which I think looks very stylish and unusual. 

Then we got:
-Colors attract attention 
-Readable text 
-Work with logo
